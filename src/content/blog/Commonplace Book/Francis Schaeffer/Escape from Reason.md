"The evangelical Christian needs to be careful because some evangelicals have recently been asserting that what matters is not setting out to prove or disprove propositions; what matters is an encounter with Jesus. When a Christian has made such a statement he has, in an analyzed or unanalyzed form, moved upstairs. If we think that we are escaping some of the pressures of the modern debate by playing down propositional Scripture and simply putting the word “Jesus” or “experience” upstairs, we must face this question: What difference is there between doing this and doing what the secular world has done in its semantic mysticism, or what the New Theology has done? At the very least the door has been opened for man to think it is the same thing. Certainly men in the next generation will tend to make it the same thing.

**If what is placed upstairs is separated from rationality, if the Scriptures are not discussed as open to verification where they touch the cosmos and history, why should one then accept the evangelical upstairs any more than the upstairs of the modern radical theology**? On what basis is the choice to be made? Why should it not just as well be an encounter under the name Vishnu? Indeed, why should one not seek an experience, without the use of any such words, in a drug experience?" 
- Context: According to Schaeffer, the modern mind has divided reality into two levels: the lower level of nature, which is the realm of facts, reason, science, and logic; and the upper level of grace, which is the realm of values, meaning, morality, and religion. Schaeffer argued that this division has led to a loss of truth and a crisis of culture, as the upper level becomes subjective and irrational, while the lower level becomes meaningless and deterministic. Schaeffer called for a Christian response that would affirm the unity of truth and the relevance of the biblical worldview for all of life.
- Aka the upper: Non-Rational - An Encounter with Jesus.
- The Lower: Rational - One does not set about proving or disproving propositions 

"I have come to the point where, when I hear the word “Jesus”—which means so much to me because of the Person of the historic Jesus and his work—I listen carefully because I have with sorrow become more afraid of the word “Jesus” than almost any other word in the modern world. The word is used as a contentless banner, and our generation is invited to follow it. But there is no rational, scriptural content by which to test it, and thus the word is being used to teach the very opposite things from those which Jesus taught. Men are called to follow the word with highly motivated fervency, and nowhere more than in the new morality which follows the New Theology. It is now Jesus-like to sleep with a girl or a man if she or he needs you. As long as you are trying to be human you are being Jesus-like to sleep with the other person, at the cost, be it noted, of breaking the specific morality which Jesus taught. But to these men this does not matter because that is downstairs in the area of rational scriptural content."
