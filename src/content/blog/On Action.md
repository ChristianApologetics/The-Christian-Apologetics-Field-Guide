"As long as \[man\] does not convert it into action, it does not matter how much he thinks about this new repentance... Wallow in it... Write a book about it; that is often an excellent way of sterilizing the seeds which \[Heavenly Father\] plants in a human soul... Do anything but act. No amount of piety in his imagination and affections will harm \[the cause of evil\] if \[it is kept\] out of his will... The more often he feels without acting, the less he will ever be able to act, and, in the long run, the less he will be able to feel."
- The Screwtape Letters

“All the healthy and out-going activities which we want him to avoid can be inhibited and nothing given in return, so that at least he may say, as one of my own patients said on his arrival down here, 'I know that I spent most of my life in doing neither what I ought nor what I liked.”
- The Screwtape Letters

"When you free yourself of the distractions of shallow or illusory pleasures and devote yourself instead to your rightful duties, you can relax. When you know you've done the best you can under the circumstances, you can have a light heart. Your mind doesn't have to moonlight, making excuses, thinking up alibis, defending your honor, feeling guilty or remorseful. You can simply, cleanly, move on to the next thing."
- Epictetus

"When you actively engage in gradually refining yourself, you retreat from your lazy ways of covering yourself or making excuses. Instead of feeling a persistent current of low-level shame, you move forward by using the creative possibilities of this moment, your current situation."
- Epictetus

"No great thing is created suddenly. There must be time. Give your best and always be kind."
- Epictetus
