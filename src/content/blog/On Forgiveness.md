"Henceforth, the disciple will look upon other men as forgiven sinners who owe their lives to the love of God." 
- Bonhoeffer

“To be a Christian means to forgive the inexcusable, because God has forgiven the inexcusable in you.”
- C.S. Lewis - On Forgiveness

It may be an infinitely less evil to murder a man than to refuse to forgive him. The former may be the act of a moment of passion: the latter is the heart’s choice. It is spiritual murder, the worst, to hate, to brood over the feeling that excludes, that, in our microcosm, kills the image, the idea of the hated.
- George Macdonald

\[ 219 \] Impossibilities
“I thank thee, Lord, for forgiving me, but I prefer staying in the darkness: forgive me that too.”-“No; that cannot be. The one thing that cannot be forgiven is the sin of choosing to be evil, of refusing deliverance. It is impossible to forgive that. It would be to take part in it.”
- George MacDonald

"However, let us suppose that he's not a good father. Perhaps he is fatuous, uneducated, unrefined, or holds views quite different from your own. Does nature give everyone an ideal father, or simply a father? When it comes to your fundamental duty as a son or a daughter, whatever your father's character may be, whatever his personality or habits are, is secondary. The divine order does not design people or circumstances according to our tastes. Whether you find him to be agreeable or not, this man is, when all is said and done, you father, and you should live up to all your filial obligations."
- Epictetus 

"Those who are dedicated to a life of wisdom understand that the impulse to blame something or someone is foolishness, that there is nothing to be gained in blaming, whether it be others or oneself."
- Epictetus 

"When someone speaks to  you curtly, disregards what you say, performs what seems to be a thoughtless gesture or even an outright evil act, think to yourself, 'If I were that person and had endured the same trials, borne the same heartbreaks, had the same parents, and so on, I probably would have done or said the same thing.' We are not privy to the stories behind people's actions, so we should be patient with others and suspend our judgement of them, recognizing the limits of our understanding. This does not mean we condone evil deeds or endorse the idea that different actions carry the same moral weight."
- Epictetus

"Forgive others for their misdeeds over and over again. This gesture fosters inner ease. Forgive yourself over and over and over again. Then try to do better next time."
- Epictetus

"To condone an evil is simply to ignore it, to treat it as if it were good. But forgiveness needs to be accepted as well as offered if it is to be complete: and a man who admits no guilt can accept no forgiveness."
- C.S. Lewis - The Problem of Pain

“Everyone says forgiveness is a lovely idea, until they have something to forgive.”
- C.S. Lewis - Mere Christianity

"We believe that God forgives us our sins; but also that He will not do so unless we forgive other people their sins against us. There is no doubt about the second part of this statement. It is in the Lord’s Prayer; it was emphatically stated by our Lord. If you don’t forgive you will not be forgiven. No part of His teaching is clearer, and there are no exceptions to it. He doesn’t say that we are to forgive other people’s sins provided they are not too frightful, or provided there are extenuating circumstances, or anything of that sort. We are to forgive them all, however spiteful, however mean, however often they are repeated. If we don’t, we shall be forgiven none of our own."
- C.S. Lewis - On Forgiveness

"But the trouble is that what we call “asking God’s forgiveness” very often really consists in asking God to accept our excuses. What leads us into this mistake is the fact that there usually is some amount of excuse, some “extenuating circumstances.” We are so very anxious to point these out to God (and to ourselves) that we are apt to forget the really important thing; that is, the bit left over, the bit which the excuses don’t cover, the bit which is inexcusable but not, thank God, unforgivable. And if we forget this, we shall go away imagining that we have repented and been forgiven when all that has really happened is that we have satisfied ourselves with our own excuses. They may be very bad excuses; we are all too easily satisfied about ourselves."
- C.S. Lewis - On Forgiveness

"The second remedy is really and truly to believe in the forgiveness of sins. A great deal of our anxiety to make excuses comes from not really believing in it, from thinking that God will not take us to Himself again unless He is satisfied that some sort of case can be made out in our favour. But that would not be forgiveness at all. Real forgiveness means looking steadily at the sin, the sin that is left over without any excuse, after all allowances have been made, and seeing it in all its horror, dirt, meanness, and malice, and nevertheless being wholly reconciled to the man who has done it. That, and only that, is forgiveness, and that we can always have from God if we ask for it."
- C.S. Lewis - On Forgiveness
