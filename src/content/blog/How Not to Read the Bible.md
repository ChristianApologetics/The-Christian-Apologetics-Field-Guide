"I realized that all my life I had been reading Genesis from the perspective of a modern person. I had read it through the lens of a historically sophisticated, scientifically influenced individual. I assumed Genesis was written to answer the questions of origins that people are asking today.
But I had never asked the most important vital question of all: What did Moses mean when he wrote this text? After all, “my Bible” was Moses’ “Bible” first. Was Moses acquainted with Charles Darwin? . . . Was he writing to discredit any modern theory of evolution? Were his readers troubled by calculations of the speed of light and the distance of the galaxies from earth? Were they puzzling over the significance of DNA? Were they debating a young earth versus an old earth? Would they have had any inkling about a modern scientific worldview?
If you agree that the answer to these questions is obviously no, then the logical question is, what was on their minds? How would they have understood Genesis 1?... _What did Genesis mean to the original author and original readers?_"
- Miller and Sodem, _In the Beginning We Misunderstood_, 21.

**Non-literal:**
"When Jesus said, “I am the bread of life,”* we know he was not literally implying he was a loaf of bread made of grain. When the writer of Psalm 17 wrote to God asking him to “hide me in the shadow of your wings” (v. 8), he didn’t mean God has physical wings and looks like a bird. When you read the Bible, you need to ask if it is meant to be a literal understanding of the words. This is not doubting God’s Word, it is just being a good student of Scripture so we understand what God was communicating. We want to grasp what God was communicating, what Genesis meant to the original author and the original readers."

**Slaves in Egypt:**
\[The Israelites\] were slaves living in the land and culture of the Egyptians. Keep in mind this was not just for a few years, but for around four hundred years.‡ Generation after generation of God’s chosen people were being immersed in a world controlled by the Egyptians, learning the Egyptian origin stories, their values, and their religious beliefs. There is debate on the exact years, but scholars believe the Israelites were in Egypt for the approximately four hundred years in slavery either in the 1200s BC or the 1400s BC. While living as slaves in Egypt, the Israelites would have passed down oral traditions and remnants of stories about Abraham and the promises God made to them. But this was still a long time to live in slavery, hundreds of years immersed in Egypt. Day after day they would wake up to see Egyptian statues of Egyptian gods, living in the Egyptians’ world with Egyptian values. The Egyptians didn’t worship the God of the Israelites, instead worshiping many different types of gods including the sun, the moon, several animal-like gods, a few goddesses, and even some people. The Egyptians had creation stories to explain how their gods had created everything. This is the world the Israelites lived in—not just for ten years or fifty years or a hundred years—but for four hundred years.

**Questions Israel Likely Had That Genesis Was Written to Answer:**
    • Are we going to survive here in the desert? Are we safe here?
    • Is there really only one God? What about all the Egyptians gods? Are they angry we left Egypt?
    • Is this God who rescued us still here, or are we alone?
    • What do we have to do to please this one God so we will have crops that won’t fail and have food for our families?
    • Should we worship the sun? Should we worship the moon like the Egyptians? Or worship like the Canaanites, who are now nearby?
    • Is the Egyptian story of how the world was made the true one?

**Questions That We Have Today That Genesis Was Not Written to Answer:**
    • How old is the earth? Six thousand years? Six billion years?
    • Was it in six literal twenty-four-hour days or six long periods of time that God made everything?
    • Does the lack of major transitional forms in the fossil records disprove evolution?
    • Could primitive nucleic acids, amino acids, and other building blocks of life have formed and organized themselves into self-replicating, self-sustaining units, laying the foundation for cellular biochemistry?
    • Was there really a talking snake?
    • Were there dinosaurs on Noah’s ark?
    • If God created Adam as the first person, did he have a belly button?

These are all interesting, great questions. But these questions wouldn’t have made any sense, or even have been asked, by the original audience of Israelites God was communicating to. Today, you and I may want to know the answers to these questions as we read Genesis through a modern lens, but the original audience would not have had these questions. God wanted to teach them other things that were equally important. They weren’t the scientific questions of our day. Knowing this matters when reading Genesis, that it wasn’t written to us to answer our questions about science and evolution.

**What God Did Want the Original Audience to Know:**
- God wanted the people to know he is the one and only true God, not the Egyptian gods or the other gods of the surrounding people groups.
- God wanted Israel to know that his presence was with them.
- God wanted the people to know who they were—his chosen people—and about the “covenant” he had made with their forefather Abraham. He wanted them to understand that all the world would be blessed through them and that he had promised them a land to live in.
- God wanted the Israelites to know he created the heavens and the earth and all that exists. His story was different from the Egyptian creation story and the other creation stories like the _Enuma Elish_ or the _Epic of Gilgamesh_. These stories told about other gods and goddesses creating everything.
- God wanted the Israelites to know he is the one true God and he is personal, compassionate, slow to anger, and abounding in love. These character qualities were very different from those of the other deities they were familiar with.
- God wanted the Israelites to know how to properly worship him and how to live as a community of people with each other in the promised land.

**Using current understandings:**
The people of that time thought the human intellect came from the actual heart and abdominal organs \[(not the brain)\]. So did God lie to them when he didn’t correct their improper usage of the “heart,” even using it himself? Not at all! God simply chose not to correct them in their incorrect understanding of heart physiology. God didn’t provide science lessons on the function of the brain. He spoke to them in the context of what they already believed. God used what they were aware of and the assumptions in their existing worldview to communicate the truths he wanted them to know at that time. He didn’t feel it was necessary to correct their “scientific” understanding of how the brain and heart worked. He wanted to make sure they got the point of what he was saying, so to communicate he used what they knew and believed.

**“In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth"**
…unlike what comes to mind when we think of the “heavens” and “earth,” the ancient Israelites would have thought of something very different....They would have immediately thought about the sky and the land they could see. God was telling them he had created all the sky and all the land they could see....The views of the ancient Israelites’ were quite similar to those of the Egyptians and other surrounding people groups.

**God Didn’t Copy the Egyptians; He Told the True Story**
- Only in Genesis do we meet a single God (not multiple gods) who has a covenantal (committed with promises) and personal relationship with people
- Unlike other narratives, the God in the Genesis creation story doesn’t need assistance from other gods to create. He is all powerful and can do it all with just his word.
- The God in the Genesis creation story creates human beings with dignity and beauty, and they are created in his image. None of the other creation stories reveal a god or gods who treat humans with such love and care.
- The God in the creation story entrusted human beings with the task of caring for the creation, rather than creating them as servants to serve the whims of that god.

**Israelite View of the World When Genesis Was Written**
- The **sky**: the sky was a vault resting on foundations-perhaps mountains-with doors and windows that let in the rain. God dwelt about the sky, hidden in cloud and majesty. 
    - “So God made the vault \[_raquia_—a solid dome\] and separated the water under the vault from the water above it. And it was so” (Genesis 1:7).
        - “Can you join him in spreading out the skies, hard as a mirror of cast bronze?” (Job 37:18).
        - “Thick clouds veil him, so he does not see us as he goes about in the vaulted heavens” (Job 22:14). Some translations read, “Thick clouds enwrap Him, so that he does not see, and He walks on the dome of heaven.”
    - *Raqa* as a verb: to hammer out, smooth, spread out.
        - Exodus 39:3
        - Genesis 7:11 - God "opens" the "windows of the skies" aka the Great Flood.
    - The *raquia* is not the source of rain, aside from "supplying" the mountains with clouds, which then bring rain. 
- The **land**: Earth/land (Hebrew: *erets*) was viewed as a disk floating on the waters (not a planet orbiting in space), secured or moored by pillars. The earth was the only known domain-the realm beyond it was considered unknowable. 
    - “For the foundations of the earth are the Lord’s; on them he has set the world” (1 Samuel 2:8).
    - “He shakes the earth from its place and makes its pillars tremble” (Job 9:6).
    - “He set the earth on its foundations; it can never be moved” (Psalm 104:5).
    - Also Psalm 102:19, 103:11. 
- The **Underworld** (Sheol): Beneath the land was a watery or dusty prison from which no one returned. Regarded as a physical place beneath the earth, it could be reached only through death.
