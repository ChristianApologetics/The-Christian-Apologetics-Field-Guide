**Al-Ghazali's Argument (Kalam)**
1. Whatever begins to exist has a cause.
2. The universe began to exist.
3. Therefore, the universe has a cause. 

**The Kalam Cosmological Argument Outline**
1. Whatever begins to exist has a case
    1. Something cannot come from nothing
        - Objection: Physics gives examples of things coming from nothing.
        - Response: The vacuum is not nothing
    2. Otherwise, anything and everything could come from nothing.
    3. Experience confirms this truth. 
2. The universe began to exist
    1. An actually infinite number of past events cannot exist
        - Objection: Math proves that it can
        - Response: Math establishes only a universe of discourse
        - Objection: We don't understand infinity
        - Response: Infinity is mathematically well understood
        - Objection: Your absurd situations are what we should expect if an actual infinite exists.
        - Response: This reply doesn't resolve the absurdities. 
    2. A series formed successively cannot be actually infinite.
        - Objection: From any past point we can reach the present
        - Response: This replay commits the fallacy of composition (the error of assuming that what is true of a member of a group is true for the group as a whole).
        1. If it could, absurdities would result.
            - Increasing disparities would vanish.
            - One would have finished already
    3. Expansion of the universe
        - Objection: Nonstandard models of the origin of the universe exist.
        - Response: Viable nonstandard models also predict a beginning.
    4. Thermodynamics of the universe
        - Objection: Models aimed at avoiding a beginning exist
        - Response: These models fail to avoid a beginning
3. Therefore, the universe has a cause.
    1. This follows from 1 and 2.
        - Objection: The universe caused itself
        - Response: Then the universe would have to exist before it came to exist.
    2. This cause is an uncaused, timeless, spaceless, immaterial, powerful Personal Creator.
