The argument is based on the concept of God as a being greater than which nothing can be conceived. 
- The argument was first proposed by Saint Anselm of Canterbury in his 1078 work, Proslogion. 
- He argued that if the greatest possible being exists in the mind, it must also exist in reality, because if it existed only in the mind, then an even greater being must be possible—one who exists both in mind and in reality. Therefore, this greatest possible being must exist in reality

1. It is possible that a maximally great being (we call "God") exists.
2. If it is possible that maximally great being exists, then a maximally great being exists in some possible world. 
3. If a maximally great being exists in some possible world, then it exists in every possible world. 
4. if a maximally maximally great being exists in every possible world, then it exists in the actual world.
5. Therefore, a maximally great being exists in the actual world. 
6. Therefore, a maximally great being exists.
7. Therefore, God exists. 

Premises 2-7 are relatively uncontroversial: most philosophers agree that if God's existence is possible then he must exist. The whole question falls to premise one: is God's existence possible? The atheist has to say that it is impossible for God to exist, that the concept of God is logically incoherent, like a married bachelor or a round square.
