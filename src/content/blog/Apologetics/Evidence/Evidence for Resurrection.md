**The Fact of Jesus’ Empty Tomb**
- First, the disciples could not have believed in Jesus’ resurrection if His corpse still lay in the tomb.
- Second, even if the disciples had preached Jesus’ resurrection despite His occupied tomb, scarcely anybody else would have believed them.
- Third, even if they had so believed, the Jewish authorities would have exposed the whole affair simply by pointing to Jesus’ tomb or perhaps even exhuming the body as decisive proof that Jesus had not been raised.

**The Evidence of Jesus' Burial**
The historical reliability of the story of Jesus’ burial supports the empty tomb:
    - 1. Jesus’ burial is reported in extremely early, independent sources.
        - Accounted in Mark, the earliest of the four gospels. 
        - Paul quotes an old Christian tradition he received from the earliest disciples. This tradition likely goes back within the first five years after Jesus' death in AD 30. The tradition is a summary of the early Christian preaching and may have been used in Christian instruction. The tradition:
            - that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scriptures, and that he was buried, and that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the scriptures, and that he appeared to Cephas, then to the Twelve.
        - The early sermons in the book of Acts, which probably preserve the early preaching of the apostles. These sermons also mention Jesus’ interment in a tomb.
    - 2. As a member of the Jewish Sanhedrin that condemned Jesus, Joseph of Arimathea is unlikely to be a Christian invention.

**The Independent Reports of the Empty Tomb:**
    - 1. The discovery of Jesus’ empty tomb is independently reported in very early sources.
    - 2. Mark’s story is simple and lacks legendary development
        - Compared to apocryphal Gospel of Peter.
    - 3. The tomb was probably discovered empty by women
        - In Jewish society, women were not regarded as credible witnesses and occupied a low rung on the Jewish social ladder.
            - “Let not the testimony of women be admitted, on account of the levity and boldness of their sex” (Josephus’s Antiquities IV.8.15).
            - “Sooner let the words of the Law be burnt than delivered to women!” (Sotah 19a)
            - “Happy is he whose children are male, but unhappy is he whose children are female!” (Kiddushin 82b)
            - “Blessed are you, Lord our God, ruler of the universe, who has not created me a Gentile, a slave, or a woman” (Berachos 60b)
        - "If the empty tomb story were a legend, then the male disciples would have been made to be the ones who discover the empty tomb. The fact that women, whose testimony was deemed worthless, were the chief witnesses to the fact of the empty tomb can only be plausibly explained if, like it or not, they actually were the discoverers of the empty tomb, and the gospels faithfully record what for them was a very embarrassing fact." - William Lane Craig - *On Guard*
    - 4. The earliest Jewish response to the proclamation of Jesus’ resurrection presupposes the empty tomb
        - "In Matthew’s gospel we find an attempt to refute the earliest Jewish response to the Christian proclamation of the resurrection (Matt. 28:11–15)...Now our interest isn’t so much in Matthew’s story of the guard at the tomb as in his incidental remark at the end, “This story has been spread among the Jews to this day.” This remark reveals that the author was concerned to refute a widespread Jewish explanation of the resurrection. Now what were unbelieving Jews saying in response to the disciples’ proclamation that Jesus was risen? That these men were full of new wine? That Jesus’ body still lay in the tomb in the garden? No. They were saying, “The disciples stole away His body.” Think about that. “The disciples stole away His body.” The Jewish authorities did not deny the empty tomb but instead entangled themselves in a hopeless series of absurdities trying to explain it away. In other words, the Jewish claim that the disciples had stolen the body presupposes that the body was missing."  - William Lane Craig - *On Guard*

**The Fact of Jesus’ Postmortem Appearances**
Various individuals and groups on different occasions and under varying circumstances experienced appearances of Jesus alive.
1. Paul's List of Eyewitnesses:
    1. Appearance to Peter
    2. Appearance to the Twelve 
        1. Most notable is Jesus' physical demonstration, i.e. showing his wounds and eating. This showed that Jesus was raised *physically* and that He was the *same Jesus* who had been crucified. 
    3. Appearance to five hundred brethren
    4. Appearance to James
    5. Appearance to "all the apostles"
    6. Appearance to Saul of Tarsus
2. The gospel accounts provide multiple, independent reports of postmortem appearances of Jesus.
3. The resurrection appearances were physical, bodily appearances.

The first disciples came sincerely to believe in Jesus’ resurrection despite every predisposition to the contrary.
1. Jews had no expectation of a Messiah who instead of triumphing over Israel’s enemies would be shamefully executed by them as a criminal.
2. Jewish beliefs about the afterlife preclude anyone’s rising from the dead to glory and immortality before the resurrection at the end of the world.

**Explaining the evidence**

A. Rival explanations do not fare well when assessed by the standard criteria for the best explanation, such as explanatory scope, explanatory power, plausibility, being contrived, disconfirmation by accepted beliefs, and outstripping its rivals in meeting these criteria.
1. Conspiracy theory
2. Apparent death theory
3. Displaced body theory
4. Hallucination theory
B. The resurrection theory when judged by these same criteria emerges as the best explanation.
