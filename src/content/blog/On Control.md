The chief task in life is simply this: to identify and separate matters so that I can say clearly to myself which are externals not under my control, and which have to do with the choices I actually control. Where then do I look for good and evil? Not to uncontrollable externals, but within myself to the choices that are my own.
- Epictetus, Discourses, 2.5.4–5

“The next moment is as much beyond our grasp, and as much in God’s care as that a hundred years away. Care for the next minute is just as foolish as care for a day in the next thousand years. And neither can we do anything, and both God is doing everything.”
- George Macdonald

"Only the morally weak feel compelled to defend or explain themselves to others. Let the quality of your deeds speak on your behalf."
- Epictetus

"Pursue the good ardently. But if your efforts fall short, accept the result and move on."
- Epictetus
