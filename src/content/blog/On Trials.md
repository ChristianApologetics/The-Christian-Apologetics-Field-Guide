"When sadness or anxiety or loneliness become overwhelming, choose to focus in breathing, let awareness rest in the body, and not unquestionably believe all the thoughts the brain throws at you."
- I May Be Wrong

"Nothing lasts. Not even difficult times."
- I May Be Wrong

"Directing our attention, choosing what we aim it at, is the best and possibly the only thing we can do when things get really hard."
- I May Be Wrong

The universe operates according to this principle: you will know what you need to know when you need to know it.
- I May Be Wrong

"A gem cannot be polished without friction, nor a man perfected without trials."
- Seneca

"Have the courage to try an undertaking and possibly do it poorly. Unremarkable lives are marked by the fear of not looking capable when trying something new."
- Epictetus

"Try to exclude the possibility of suffering which the order of nature and the existence of free wills involve, and you find that you have excluded life itself."
- C.S. Lewis - The Problem of Pain

"‘You must be strong with my strength and blessed with my blessedness, for I have no other to give you.’...God gives what He has, not what He has not: He gives the happiness that there is, not the happiness that is not. To be God—to be like God and to share His goodness in creaturely response—to be miserable—these are the only three alternatives. If we will not learn to eat the only food that the universe grows—the only food that any possible universe ever can grow—then we must starve eternally."
- C.S. Lewis - The Problem of Pain

"God whispers to us in our pleasures, speaks in our conscience, but shouts in our pain: it is His megaphone to rouse a deaf world."
- C.S. Lewis - The Problem of Pain

"Thomas Aquinas said of suffering, as Aristotle had said of shame, that it was a thing not good in itself; but a thing which might have a certain goodness in particular circumstances. That is to say, if evil is present, pain at recognition of the evil, being a kind of knowledge, is relatively good; for the alternative is that the soul should be ignorant of the evil, or ignorant that the evil is contrary to its nature, ‘either of which’, says the philosopher, ‘is manifestly bad’."
- C.S. Lewis - The Problem of Pain
